## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aeliydse/starstorm.git
cd starstorm

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from starstorm.core import system_manager
from starstorm.simulation import atmospheric_model
from starstorm.propulsion import engine_model

# Initialize the system
system = system_manager.SystemManager()

# Configure a simulation environment
atm = atmospheric_model.AtmosphericModel()
atm.configure(altitude=100000, latitude=45.0, longitude=120.0)

# Set up a propulsion system
engine = engine_model.RocketEngine(thrust=10000, isp=320)

# Run a simulation
system.add_component(atm)
system.add_component(engine)
system.initialize()
system.run_simulation(duration=3600)  # Simulate for 1 hour
```
