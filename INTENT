# STARSTORM SDK INTENT STATEMENT

## Purpose

The Starstorm SDK is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for the research, design, modeling, simulation, and theoretical prototyping of advanced space combat drone concept. This software is intended to serve as an educational and research tool for aerospace engineering, autonomous systems development, artificial intelligence, and related technical disciplines.

## Acceptable Use Cases

The Starstorm SDK is intended for:

1. **Academic Research**: Supporting theoretical and applied research in autonomous space systems, propulsion technologies, navigation algorithms, and related fields.

2. **Educational Purposes**: Providing students and educators with a platform to learn about spacecraft design, orbital mechanics, control systems, and artificial intelligence in aerospace applications.

3. **Theoretical Modeling**: Enabling the conceptual design and simulation of space systems without physical implementation.

4. **Algorithm Development**: Creating and testing new algorithms for autonomous decision-making, path planning, and mission execution in simulated space environments.

5. **System Integration Studies**: Researching the interactions between various spacecraft subsystems in a controlled, simulated environment.

## Limitations and Restrictions

The Starstorm SDK is NOT intended for:

1. **Operational Systems**: This software should not be used to control or operate actual spacecraft, drones, or any physical systems.

2. **Military Applications**: The SDK is not designed or intended for use in developing operational military systems or weapons.

3. **Commercial Products**: The SDK should not be used to develop commercial products without explicit permission from the copyright holders.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: The simulations and models provided are not certified for regulatory compliance and should not be used as the sole basis for safety-critical decisions.

5. **Illegal Activities**: Any use of this software that violates international laws, treaties, or regulations is strictly prohibited.

## Ethical Considerations

Users of the Starstorm SDK are expected to:

1. Consider the ethical implications of autonomous systems in space.

2. Respect international space law and principles of peaceful use of outer space.

3. Acknowledge that the development of autonomous systems carries significant ethical responsibilities.

4. Use the knowledge gained through this SDK to contribute positively to humanity's understanding and peaceful use of space.
